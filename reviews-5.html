             <span>If you don’t mind drinking out of it…</span>
         </div>
         <p>It’s a good concept and it works only if you don’t mind drinking out of it with a very long straw. the ice cubes stick together and clump up and won’t come out of the small spout if they made the spout bigger maybe they could come out this thing. Also is half the ice cubes break up and a little shards but it works just fine for my iced coffee as long as I pour my drink in the contraption</p>

         <p>I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It's small so it doesn't take up much room on the
             bathroom counter. Super simple to use with easy to follow directions. Gets the brushes perfectly clean. This
             is a great value.</p>
